## What sparks joy?

[Fish](https://fishshell.com/)

[i3](https://i3wm.org/)

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

[JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

There are so many great fonts for programming. JetBrains Mono probably sparks
the most joy, but I also love Fira Code and Cascadia Code.

[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

In the past I have used Terminal, Terminator, GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Hyper,
and iTerm 2. None of these have really felt complete for me. Alacritty meets my
two basic requirements with with flying colours: it is extremely fast, and
configuration is dead simple.
